                            <span className={styles.colorChange}> Tranquillity Cranes</span> team! 
                            As BCIT students of the Digital Design and Development program, we designed, tested, and developed this app for our MDIA 2109 & MDIA 2106 class, showcasing our unique abilities and skills that we learned from these classes.

                        Tranquility Cranes is an app and companion designed towards those who need a helping hand to get through lifeâ€™s chaos. 
                        We wanted to create an app that would help people through stress, anxiety and other mental health related issues. 
                        Many individuals experience stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges, often without easy access to professional help. Our app has the potential to bridge this gap by providing users with a convenient platform to access resources, learn coping techniques, and connect with a supportive community. By creating an app dedicated to mental well-being, we're not only offering practical tools for managing mental health but also fostering a culture of openness and understanding around these important issues.
